# CRC-in-Python

This is a simple Python program that I developed during my fourth semester of studying Computer Science that
simulates the CRC algorithm using integers as the representation of binary digits.

The program asks input from the user the length of the messages that will be transmited and the BER(Bit Error Rate). <br>
Then proceedes on adding errors to a percentage of the transmited messages based on the given BER. <br>
Afterwards the CRC algorithm is being applied to each one of the messages. <br>
Lastly the output of the program containts the messages transmited, the number of them that the algorithm detected as altered as well as
the number of them that it didnt manage to detect.
